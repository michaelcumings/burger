# Eat-Da-Burger

Eat-Da-Burger is an app that asks users to input the
names of burgers they'd like to eat and stores them in
a database.  When the burger is initially added, it
appears in a list on the left with a "Devour It!"
button.  When the button is clicked, the database is
updated to reflect that the burger has been devoured
and the name of the burger is moved to the list on the
right, for devoured burgers.

This app was done with a custom ORM, serving the HTML
pages using handlebars templating.

The app is hosted on heroku at:
